## Jest

React scripts has a built in suite called [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) which can usually be run with the command `react-scripts test`. 

This will watch and run all the tests in the project (`./src/features/_tests_`) against the React code as you are developing and so gives early warnings of problems. Best practice is to run `npm test` as well as `npm start` while developing.
